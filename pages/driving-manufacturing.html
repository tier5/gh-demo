                        <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4721822/">Integrating sensors into machines</a> is one of the key methods of optimizing the manufacturing process. Usage information gets recorded by these sensors and transmitted to the Cloud, which can then be read by the industry experts. This process ensures correct data is utilized, allowing important changes to occur for product creation and optimization.</p>

                        <h3>Product Optimization</h3>
                        <p>Product optimization is a common goal across manufacturing industries. The purpose is to design products that are both desirable and durable. Cloud computing allows manufacturers to calculate results based on product life, overall sales, and other key factors.</p>
                        <p>This data proves which products need enhancing and allows for companies to come up with quick fixes for problems. The items can then be altered and put back on the market, so new data begins recording immediately. This automated design technique is an advanced program that ensures product coherence across the industry.</p>

                        <p>Going along with product optimization is customization. Customers can receive customized products that truly meet their needs thanks to the data computed into the Cloud. Consumer demand is a major concern for companies, as they need to know how much or little of a product to create. Thanks to the data recorded during every stage of the manufacturing process and afterwards, product volumes can be adjusted accordingly.</p>

                        <p>In today’s world of smartphones and technological advances, smart manufacturing is now a key term for any data-related process for manufacturing techniques. The goal is to make all processes from machine to plant, plant to enterprise, and enterprise to supply chain more efficient and reliable. Efficiency can be accomplished with ease with the use of technology and cloud computing.</p>
                        <p>Data is now recorded consistently by manufacturing equipment and machines which can then be both viewed but also intelligently analyzed. All data is computed for efficiency before a single staff member even looks it over. Once the already-analyzed data has been assessed by dedicated team members via the Cloud, processes can be modified to achieve better efficiency, quality and smoother operations.</p>

                        <p>Machines with sensors are not only able to record process and product data, but also information regarding the machine itself. If any malfunctioning or errors occurs, relevant data is sent directly to the Cloud. It may come across when a machine stops outputting data or otherwise displays a technical error message. Maintenance workers will immediately be notified of the issue and can get straight to work on a solution. Cutting down maintenance time also ensures machines are up and running faster, greatly improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process.</p>

Companies have designed various cloud services based on each step of the production process. Services for product design are going to differ from services for testing. There are also options for manufacturing and management.</p>

                        <p>One of the main goals of using cloud computing in any business is lowering energy usage. High energy usage is a federal concern that warrants change across the nation. An energy optimized machine and streamlined process thanks to cloud computing helps to lower the amount of energy that gets used on a regular basis. The process is not only important for the environment, but also helps businesses cut down on their energy bills, which is a win-win. <a href="https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/02/f19/QTR%20Ch8%20-%20Smart%20Manufacturing%20TA%20Feb-13-2015.pdf">Energy optimization</a>  is easier and more straightforward thanks to cloud computing.</p>

                        <p>Not all companies can get cloud computing services up and running quickly. It takes a great deal of money to start the process and purchase the machines and equipment necessary. <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1462910"> The National Science Foundation has a grant</a> available for companies looking to achieve higher quality processing with the help of a cloud-based framework. The relationship between the quality, energy usage, throughput, and maintenance of a machine is all analyzed and recorded, so the information is utilized for a company’s benefit.</p>

                        <p>Cloud computing is the future of business. All recorded data helps to drive manufacturing efficiency and make it more worthwhile for the company and the customer. With these benefits considered, all manufacturing businesses should see how cloud computing is an attractive option for the growth and improvement of their company.</p>
