                                 The technology behind Hosted VoIP is essentially the same regardless of which provider you
                                 choose for your business. The major difference comes in how the technology is delivered:
                                 every hosted provider will have its own strengths and weaknesses. To further complicate
                                 the issue, each provider uses its own keywords and phrases making comparing your available
                                 options more difficult. When choosing a company to provide you with the best solution,
                                 it's important to have some basic questions to ask so that your research will be based on
                                 level ground. So, with that being said, here are five questions to ask your hosted phone
                                 provider.
                              </p>

                                 <p><strong>1. &nbsp;How is Call Quality Controlled?</strong></p>
                              <p>
                                 Call quality is king. There isn't much use to any hosted provider if you can't understand
                                 the person on the other end. Some of the sub-standard providers have given hosted voice
                                 products a bad name. Echo (hearing yourself) or jitter (only hearing parts and pieces) are
                                 two of the most common problems you can have with typical providers. They have given
                                 hosted voice products a bad name. As I mentioned in a <a href=
                                 "/blogs/comparing-hosted-voip-service.html" title=
                                 "Comparing The Three Main Types of Hosted VoIP Service">previous post</a> there are
                                 several different ways to try and guarantee quality. It is vitally important that any
                                 hosted provider not only provides a quality call, but also has the ability to monitor that
                                 quality in an ongoing fashion.
                              </p>


                              <p>
                                 <strong>2. When was the last time you were down, and how long were you down
                                 for?&nbsp;</strong>
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 It's important to know the details of the past performance of your provider. Asking
                                 questions about the frequency and duration of past outages will give you an idea of what
                                 to expect. Also, you may want to know about planned maintenance as well. A lot of times
                                 planned maintenance may take longer than expected and carriers will not count this against
                                 their service level agreements. Another thing you may want to look at is options for fail
                                 over in the event your internet connection goes down. Some hosted providers allow options
                                 to keep your office connected through alternative methods. For example <a href=
                                 "http://www.star2star.com">Star2Star</a> phones allow you to use plain telephone lines in
                                 case of an outage.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 Also, you could fail over to alternative connectivity such as fixed wireless as well. This
                                 allows you to get around local loop issues or inside wiring problems.
                              </p>


                              <p>
                                 <strong>3. What disaster recovery do you have in place?</strong>
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 In the event of a disaster, what options do you have? It's important to plan for the
                                 inevitable. Most carriers will have at least two data centers. These are essential to
                                 continue to operate at least in a reduced manner should a disaster strike. Some carriers
                                 have an even larger foot print with additional data centers. In the event that a natural
                                 disaster hits the east coast, the west coast servers would be able to handle your calls.
                                 In the event that your office is down for the count, or even one of the data centers is
                                 down. The alternative data center would take over handling your calls. You would be able
                                 to have an automated attendant answer and route your calls to any available numbers. So
                                 for example, someone calls your main number during a natural disaster. A message would
                                 come on saying "Thank you for calling ABC Company, press 1 for sales, 2 for support" etc.
                                 They could press the number of who they would like to get, and then instead of routing to
                                 a desk phone, it could route to a cell phone. Alternatively, it could also route to
                                 another office, or perhaps a copper land line.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 <strong>4. Who provisions and installs your equipment?</strong>
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 Do you want to spend the time to install your own telephone equipment? Do you know where
                                 to plug everything in?&nbsp;Do you know how to troubleshoot your network if something goes
                                 wrong? The best technology in the world is nothing more than a expensive door stop if it
                                 isn't installed properly. There are an incredible amount of considerations that must be
                                 taken into account. Network switching, and the appropriate configuration of VLAN's would
                                 be one of the less thought of yet incredibly important install considerations that most
                                 DIY installers would not be able to do. There are also a lot of follow up options that are
                                 equally important. Training is typically not done, or not done well in a DIY install. Even
                                 if it is done, its pretty tough to be trained by someone that has no more experience than
                                 you do. Finally, managing the porting (transferring your numbers from the old carrier)
                                 takes a bit of knowledge.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 Also, taking the time to make sure that the old lines are terminated with the previous
                                 carrier is important and a very big potential pitfall.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 <strong>5. How much bandwidth do you use per call?</strong>
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                 This is pretty self-explanatory the more bandwidth required per call the more bandwidth
                                 you need to have. Often times any savings you may have from switching to a hosted phone
                                 system, is lost on additional bandwidth.
                              </p>
